The data is in CSV format and includes all historical data on the pandemic up to 03/01/2023, following a 1-line format per country and date.

This project used data science to analyze COVID-19 data from India, focusing on death count, total vaccination done, new cases, and total deaths. 
The goal of the project was to identify trends and patterns in the data that could be used to inform public health decision-making.

The data was collected from a variety of sources, including the Indian government website, the World Health Organization, and Johns Hopkins University. 
The data was then cleaned and preprocessed to ensure that it was consistent and ready for analysis.

The following tasks were performed as part of this project:
Analyze the relationship between vaccination rates and COVID-19 cases and deaths.
Identify the factors that are most associated with severe COVID-19 illness and death.
Predict the future course of the pandemic in India.
Develop a risk assessment tool to help Apollo Energy Analytics identify employees and customers who are at high risk of COVID-19 complications.
Evaluate the effectiveness of different COVID-19 prevention and control measures.
Identify areas where Apollo Energy Analytics can improve its COVID-19 response.
